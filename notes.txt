Cabling Best Practices for Multi-Gigabit operations
 

While Category-5e cables can support multigigabit data rates upto 2.5/5 Gbps, external factors such as noise, alien crosstalk coupled with longer cable/cable bundle lengths can impede reliable link operation. Noise can originate from cable bundling, RFI, cable movement, lightning, power surges and other transient event. It is recommended to use Category-6a cabling for reliable multigigabit operations as it mitigates alien crosstalk by design.
