Cabling Best Practices for Multi-Gigabit operations
 

While Category-5e cables can support multigigabit data rates upto 2.5/5 Gbps, external factors such as noise, alien crosstalk coupled with longer cable/cable bundle lengths can impede reliable link operation. Noise can originate from cable bundling, RFI, cable movement, lightning, power surges and other transient event. It is recommended to use Category-6a cabling for reliable multigigabit operations as it mitigates alien crosstalk by design.

Channel utilization should be under 50%.

5GHz = recommended 40 MHz
6GHz = recommended 80 MHz

No more than 3 SSIDs per AP

In order to ensure quality of experience it is recommended to have around 25 clients per radio or 50 clients per AP in high-density deployments.

A common estimate of a device's actual throughput is about half of the data rate as advertised by its manufacturer. As noted above, it is important to also reduce this value to the data rate for a 20 MHz channel width. Below are the most common data rates and the estimated device throughput (half of the advertised rate). Given the multiple factors affecting performance it is a good practice to reduce the throughput further by 30%
