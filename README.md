# Meraki Wi-Sizer Tool

## Overview
The Meraki Wi-Sizer Tool is a web-based application built with Streamlit to **estimate the required number of Meraki Access Points (APs) for a given indoor office environment**. This tool provides a preliminary wireless sizing estimation based on area, user density, and predefined scenarios, helping users make data-driven decisions about their Meraki wireless deployments.

## Features
- **Scenario-Based AP Estimation** â€“ Choose from predefined office layouts to determine the number of APs required.
- **Wi-Fi Generation Selection** â€“ Supports Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E, and Wi-Fi 7 for accurate model recommendations.
- **AP Model Recommendations** â€“ Suggests the best Meraki AP model based on user density and bandwidth needs.
- **PoE Switch Integration** â€“ Optionally recommends PoE switches to power APs based on power and bandwidth requirements.
- **Detailed AP & Switch Specifications** â€“ Retrieves relevant device details from structured JSON-based data files.
- **Streamlit Web UI** â€“ Simple and interactive interface for seamless wireless network sizing.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Streamlit** (for the UI)
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **JSON** (for storing details)

## How to Use
1. Select the relevant input parameters:
   - Number of users
   - Estimated area (mÂ²)
   - Ceiling height (m)
   - Scenario selection (Office 1, Office 2, Office 3, Auditorium)
   - Wi-Fi generation (Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E, Wi-Fi 7)
   - Option to include PoE switches
2. Click **Calculate** to get AP and switch recommendations.
